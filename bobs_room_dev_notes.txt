Title:
Bob's room

In a simple message box on the top left corner this text is shown:
"Bob is an organized person who likes simplicity."

Under it in another simple message quest box shown with a bit larger text size:
"How can you improve Bob's room?"

This is not part of the UI, just description of the room:
The room contains a bed, a pillow, a wringkled blanket on the bed, a window with an old curtain with a hole on it, an empty table on the left side with a backpack leaning against it and some rubbish papers on the floor.

The view is from a sideway camera angle, looking directly at the bed and above that the window.




Options:
    1. Clean up the trash papers from the floor.
    2. Fold the blanket.
    3. Replace the curtain with a new one.
    4. Close the curtain.
    5. Open the window.
    6. Add another table.
    7. Add flowers under the window.
    8. Add a spine friendly mattress.
    9. Move the bed to the corner.
    10. Rotate the bed.
    11. Flip the pillow.
    12. Wash the bedding.
    13. Give up.
    14. Put the backpack on the table.
    15. Sweep the floor.
    16. I'm done.

The options are visible on the right side of the screen in a list.
Each option is under each other in ascending order.


Mechanic:
When an option is selected a dialog pop up becomes visible, which displays the dialog text and "Yes", "No" buttons.

Dialog content for each option:
1.
    Do you think the wringked papers on the floor are trash?
    Do you think Bob thinks of them the same?

    Should we proceed clean it up?
        Yes
            If the papers on the ground would really be trash, that would mean Bob's room is not organized because it has trash on the ground.
            In short, Bob is not organized if his room has trash around.
            Do you agree?
                Yes
                    But we do know for a fact that Bob is organized, right?
                    In that case we can conclude that the papers on the ground are in fact no trash.
                    It must be, because otherwise, the room is not organized, thereby Bob also. Which can not be.
                    So, we already know that it has a purpose being there, so who knows it could be important.
                    
                    What do you think? Would you still throw it away despite we know it is there on purpose?
                        Yes
                            Keep it mind, we are here to improve the room, and we are about to throw something away that we know are meant to be there.

                            Would throwing this away would be a real improvement?
                                Yes
                                    The papers are gone.

                        No
                            Nothing happens the pop up closes.
                No
                    Are you saying Bob is organized when his room is not? - Weird.
                    Yes
                        Nothing happens the pop up closes.
            
            That means the papers are there for a reason.
        No

2.
    Do you think Bob left the blanket unfolded out of carelessness?
        Yes
            But we do know that Bob is organized, right?
            Why would he leave the blanket unfolded then?
            This doesn't make any sense...
            Unless... it's on purpose!
            Okay, so - Bob left the blanket there as it is for a reason.

            Should we proceed folding it anyway?
                Yes
                    The wrinked blanked it replaced with a folded one.

        No
            Then why would you fold it?

            Should we leave it as it is?
            Yes
                Nothing happens the pop up closes.
            No
                So... we are folding it for no reason?

                Should we fold it anyway?
                Yes
                    The wrinked blanked it replaced with a folded one.

3.
    It's weird that Bob left such an old holey curtain hanging there, isn't it?

    Do you think that's something worth giving a thought to?  
        Yes
            Alright.
            Let's get the cogs started!

            Why would Bob do that?
            Why would Bob leave such an old holy curtain hanging right there?

            Do you think he had a plan with it?
            Do you think he is already in the process of replacing it with a new one himself?
            Do you think the curtain has some short of sentimental value to him?

            Should we proceed replacing the old curtain despite our newly gained doubts?
                Yes
                    The old holy curtain is replaced with a new one.

        No
            Agreed.
            Why should we waste time with such nonsense anyway?
            We are the authority here after all.

            Should we proceed replacing that old joke of a curtain with a new stylish one?
            Bob is certainly will be grateful for that, right?
                Yes
                    The old holy curtain is replaced with a new one.

    Why would he leave the curain open on such a day?
    The sun is burning hot, right?
    This is fairly obvious that we have to open the curtain, right?

    Should we close the curtain?
        Yes
            The curtain is closed.

        No
            What do you mean no?
            Why not?

            Is there something we should consider?
                Yes
                    Like what?
                    What reason Bob could have in his mind that made him think that the curtain is ment to be closed today?!?

                    Let's sit back a little and gather what we know before we force the issue.

                    All we know right now is that Bob is organized, right?
                    That might leave us with a hint that he might just have left the curtain closed for a reason, right?

                    Should we take a risk and close the curtain despite that we don't know why it is closed?
                        Yes
                            The curtain is closed.

                    Then let's just close the curtain already!
                        Yes
                            The curtain is closed.

    Weird.
    The window is closed.
    Why would he leave the window closed on such a beautiful day?

    Should we just open it?
    That sounds like an improvement to me.
        Yes

    This room feels quite empty to me.

    Why don't we just add another table?
    I'm sure Bob would appreciate that.

    Should we add a new table to room?

    Look at his mattress!
    It's way too soft for a decent human to lay on, right?

    Should we replace his mattress with a better, spine friendly one?

    That bed over there.
    Yes, that one.
    That is surely out of place where it is now.
    Moving it to the corner is much more convenient due to less air flow impact, and it is comfortable to sleep there.

    Shall we move his bed to the corner?
        Yes

    His bed.
    It is easy to see that his bed is facing the wrong direction.
    I'm sure he did not mean to have his bed facing that side.

    Should we rotate his bed into to correct direction for him?
        Yes
            Rotate the bed.

    It might seem like a minor improvement at first, but in fact occasional pillow flipping
    improves sleep quality by having the dirty side facing downwards.
    I'm quite sure he does not know this.
    Why would he?
    Let's not waste time and help min out.

    Should we flip his pillow?
        Yes
            Flip the pillow.

    From here, it looks as if his bedding were not been washed lately.
    There is no time to waste, he could be back at any moment.
    We have to make as much improvements as we can before that!
    Let's make haste and remove the sheet cover.

    Should we wash his bedding for him?
        Yes
            Remove the beddings.

                    If you insist, I won't and can't hold you back.
                    But... I will ask you one more time just to be sure.

                    Are you sure you are giving up right here and now?

    Look like he forgot to put his backpack on the table.
    I know that many people would rather prefer keeping their bags on the table rather than next to it.
    He might not be as organized as he claims he is?

    Should we put the backpack on the table?
        Yes
            Move the backpack to the table.
